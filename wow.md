# Howdy!
This is an example of a Markdown file with various elements including headers, paragraphs, links, lists and images. I am doing this [with Paul Hibbits's demo](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulhibbitts/oeglobal-demo-wednesday-live-docsify-this/main/pages&homepage=create-and-host-a-markdown-file.md&edit-link=https://github.com/paulhibbitts/oeglobal-demo-wednesday-live-docsify-this/blob/main/pages/create-and-host-a-markdown-file.md&edit-link-text=Suggest%20an%20Edit%20to%20this%20Page%20on%20GitHub&browser-tab-title=Create%20and%20Host%20Markdown%20Files%20on%20GitHub%20or%20Codeberg&toc=true&toc-headings=h2,h3&dark-mode=true#/) 

## Example Link
Hereâ€™s a link to [Docsify-This](https://docsify-this.net) that allows you to easily publish Markdown files as web pages.

## Example Lists
Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Here is an example of each

### Favorite Foods

### Ordered List:
1. First step
2. Second step
   1. Sub-step

## Let's Travel!
Maybe we can fly to Saturn with this image the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST):
